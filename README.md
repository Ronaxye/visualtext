# VisualText
Welcome to VisualText! This is a programming language that allows you to code powerful apps while using the minimal amount of code. This is augmented by the fact that you can see a colour-coded, visual representation of your code and what it does. This tutorial aims to familiarise you with the interface of VisualText, and get you started.

# Resources Used
We didn't use much resources; 99% of it was coded by ourself. However, we will honour all the sites which which helped us:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1592876/make-a-borderless-form-movable
https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11114/Move-window-form-without-Titlebar-in-C
These two sites made moving/dragging the borderless windows around possible; to move the window, the user can drag the top menu bar (the one with the title).
